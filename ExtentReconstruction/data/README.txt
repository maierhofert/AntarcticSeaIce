the data needed to run this file is not included in this repository for two reasons:
1. It's too big.
2. It's not my data. 
The Antarctic sea ice concentration data is publicly available from the website of the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). We used the climate data record (CDR) daily concentration fields from the NOAA/NSIDC CDR of Passive Microwave Sea Ice Concentration, Version 4 which can be downloaded from https://nsidc.org/data/g02202meier2016climatedatarecordV4}. 
The predictor variables for our model are the data compiled by
